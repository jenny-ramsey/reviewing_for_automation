Makers Challenge for Automating Checking module - May 2025

Challenge Part 1 - Hypothetical Tests:
Task:
For each of the hypothetical tests, decide whether they are suitable candidates for automation, rather than running the tests manually and having a human checking the outcomes and behaviours.

Challenge Part 2 - Your Tests:
Task:
Continuing within the same pairs that you were in for creating your updated TodoMVC test plan, find the list of tests which you prepared in that plan.
For each one of those tests, consider for which of the following it would be a candidate:

Automate Now
Automate Later
Don't Automate
